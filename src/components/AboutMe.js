                I have been developing websites for over 3 years. I make use of MERN(MongoDB, Express, ReactJS and NodeJS).

                I create responsive websites that are displayed on all devices, desktops and smartphones. I am a team player and a web developer, passionate to use frontend and Nodejs skills to build great web/mobile applications in creating great user experience.

                In striving to increase knowledge and contribute value, I have achieved a Masters degree in computer science and gained two years working experience in assisting content editors, developers and project managers/coordinators with maintenance and technical development of the universityâ€™s multiple websites at Texas Southern University. I have personally worked on multiple projects, to deepen my understanding on how things work, build up resilience to turn challenges into success and I strongly believe I can compete at any level.

                I consider myself forever a student, I'm always eager to strenghten my career in software engineering by staying in tune with the latest technology trends through hardwork and continued coursework.

                I believe that mindfulness plus great work ethics will always lead to success. A quality that was self-taught through mind exercising meditation and long distance jogging that i have embranced as hobby.

                I am currently seeking a job and interested in a challenge. Reach out to me on <br />
